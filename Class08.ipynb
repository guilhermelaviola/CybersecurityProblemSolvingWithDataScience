        "# **Malware Analysis**\n",
        "Malware, short for malicious software, includes various harmful programs such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware that are designed to damage systems, steal data, or disrupt operations. Because malware is constantly evolving, its detection and analysis require a combination of techniques, including signature-based detection, behavioral monitoring, static and dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, and network traffic inspection. Specialized tools like IDA Pro, Ghidra, Cuckoo Sandbox, and VirusTotal support these processes by helping analysts understand malware behavior, origin, and impact. Effective malware analysis and removal are essential for strengthening security defenses and protecting systems and data from ongoing cyber threats."
