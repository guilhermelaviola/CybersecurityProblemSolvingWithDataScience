# Cybersecurity Problem Solving with Data Science
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Cybersecurity Problem Solving with Data Science. Cybersecurity and data science work together to protect digital systems by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to detect, prevent, and respond to threats. Data analysis supports key cybersecurity functions such as threat data analysis, log analysis, behavioral analysis, and malware detection, enabling early identification of attacks and vulnerabilities. Core security areas—including network security, identity and access management, data security, and vulnerability analysis—help safeguard systems and sensitive information, while threat modeling and APT analysis anticipate complex, long-term attacks. Effective incident response and security incident management ensure rapid containment and recovery, supported by strong information security best practices and user awareness to reduce risks such as social engineering.
